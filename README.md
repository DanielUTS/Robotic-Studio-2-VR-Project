# Virtually control a Cobot using a virtual reality headset and controller.

The aim of this project is to connect a VR system to a robot that enables users to control 
the robot arm by moving their own arms and grip items using a human hand gripping end effector. 
The end goal is to be able to perform a variety of tasks using the VR controller and different end effector.
