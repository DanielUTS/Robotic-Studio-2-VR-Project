@brief The project aims to connect a Virtual Reality (VR) system to a Sawyer robot, enabling users to control the robot arm by moving their own arms and interacting with the environment using a human hand gripping end effector. It aims to provide a seamless interface for intuitive control and precise manipulation of objects, opening up possibilities for remote manual labor activities and improving safety and efficiency in various domains.

## Features and Functionalities

* Intuitive Control: Users can intuitively control the robot's movements by mirroring their own arm motions, providing a natural and immersive control experience.

* Precise Object Manipulation: The system enables precise manipulation of objects, allowing users to perform tasks such as picking up and moving items with accuracy and finesse.

* Remote Control Capabilities: The project focuses on enabling remote control of the Sawyer robot, allowing operators to perform tasks from a different room or location, increasing flexibility and safety.

* Reusability and Adaptability: The project's design allows for reusability in various applications, making it adaptable to different use cases and allowing users to customize and extend its functionality as per their requirements.

* Safety Measure: The robot is equipped with safety mechanisms keep the movement under a given velocity limits, moves outside pre-programmed boundaries, or to prevent collisions with predefined objects in the environment.

* Low Latency and Lag: Efforts have been made to minimize input lag and latency, providing a responsive and seamless experience when  controlling the Sawyer robot with the VR controllers.

* Mode of Control: there is different mode of control in this
