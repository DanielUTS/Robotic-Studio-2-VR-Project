The project aims to connect a Virtual Reality (VR) system to a Sawyer robot, enabling users to control the robot arm by moving their own arms and interacting with the environment using a human hand gripping end effector. It aims to provide a seamless interface for intuitive control and precise manipulation of objects, opening up possibilities for remote manual labor activities and improving safety and efficiency in various domains.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Intuitive Control\+: Users can intuitively control the robot\textquotesingle{}s movements by mirroring their own arm motions, providing a natural and immersive control experience.
\item Precise Object Manipulation\+: The system enables precise manipulation of objects, allowing users to perform tasks such as picking up and moving items with accuracy and finesse.
\item Remote Control Capabilities\+: The project focuses on enabling remote control of the Sawyer robot, allowing operators to perform tasks from a different room or location, increasing flexibility and safety.
\item Reusability and Adaptability\+: The project\textquotesingle{}s design allows for reusability in various applications, making it adaptable to different use cases and allowing users to customize and extend its functionality as per their requirements.
\item Safety Measure\+: The robot is equipped with safety mechanisms keep the movement under a given velocity limits, moves outside pre-\/programmed boundaries, or to prevent collisions with predefined objects in the environment.
\item Low Latency and Lag\+: Efforts have been made to minimize input lag and latency, providing a responsive and seamless experience when controlling the Sawyer robot with the VR controllers.
\item Mode of Control\+: there is different mode of control in this
